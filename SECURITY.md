# Security Policy

## Supported versions

While this package is in its `0.x` line, security fixes are released against the latest minor version only.

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| `0.x` (latest) | Yes |
| older | No |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report them privately through GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/pushery/visual-feedback-for-laravel/security/advisories/new) (the "Report a vulnerability" button on the repository's Security tab). Include:

- a description of the vulnerability and its impact,
- the steps to reproduce it,
- the affected version(s),
- and, if possible, a suggested fix.

You can expect an acknowledgment within **3 business days** and an assessment of the report, including a remediation timeline, within **10 business days**. We will keep you informed throughout and credit you in the release notes once a fix ships, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Dependency updates

This package declares version ranges, not a lock file: the versions of its dependencies in your application come from your own `composer.lock`. Keep them current with `composer update`, and run `composer audit` to check them against the known advisories.

The package checks the ranges it declares, at both ends:

- `composer audit` **fails the build** on a known advisory.
- Every build resolves fresh against the newest version each constraint allows, so a breaking release of a dependency surfaces here before it reaches you.
- The **declared minimums** are installed and tested as well, so the floor this package publishes is exercised rather than assumed.
- The suite also runs against the **next PHP minor**.

This repository is a read-only mirror of the released tree. Releases arrive as tags, and it carries no update pull requests.
